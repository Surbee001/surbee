It builds trust and a solid relationship between you and your customers.\n\nKeep reading to learn how to create a customer satisfaction survey that’ll help you improve retention and loyalty.\n\n## Customer satisfaction definition and CSAT surveys explained\n\nCustomer satisfaction measures how happy your customers are with your services, products, and experiences. It assesses your ability to meet your customer’s expectations and provide them with a positive customer experience (CX). A great CX can lead to lower churn, improved revenue, and a higher customer lifetime value.\n\nOne of the leading metrics to measure customer loyalty is the [Customer Satisfaction Score](https://www.surveymonkey.com/use-cases/customer-satisfaction/) (CSAT). Alongside [Net Promoter Score®](https://www.surveymonkey.com/use-cases/net-promoter-score/) (NPS®) and [Customer Effort Score](https://www.surveymonkey.com/use-cases/customer-effort-score/) (CES), CSAT contributes to building a valuable [Voice of the Customer program](https://www.surveymonkey.com/use-cases/voice-of-customer/) (VoC).\n\nThe CSAT asks customers to rate their overall experience with your brand. There isn’t any one specific question you have to use as long as customers have the opportunity to rate your business on a five or seven-point scale.\n\nRecord the number of customers that consider themselves satisfied (4 or 5) out of the total number of customers and multiply by 100x. This method will give you the percentage of satisfied customers with your company.\n\nYou can then compare this to the [American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI)](https://theacsi.org/) to benchmark your overall success.\n\nBy getting feedback on your CSAT score, you can prepare an [action plan to improve your score](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/customer-feedback/how-to-improve-csat/). Over time, this can help you reduce customer churn and improve your company’s revenue.\n\n## Why are customer surveys important?\n\nCustomer feedback surveys help companies understand what drives loyalty and retention. They provide insights into customer needs, highlight opportunities ot improve the experience, and guide strategies that build long-term satisfaction.\n\nA positive customer experience is one of the most determining factors when it comes to winning return customers and building loyalty. Around [91% of customers](https://www.surveymonkey.com/resources/premium/2023-state-of-cx-research-report/) are likely to recommend your company after a positive experience.\n\nEqually, when done wrong, [89% of CX pros](https://www.surveymonkey.com/resources/premium/2023-state-of-cx-research-report/) believe that a poor customer experience is the single leading contributor to customer churn.\n\nBy understanding the factors contributing to [great customer satisfaction](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/customer-feedback/customer-satisfaction-important-focus/), you can build better customer experiences. Considering every company will have different strengths and weaknesses regarding these improvements, it’s always a good idea to launch personalized surveys to your customers.\n\n![](https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/de0118d4394881ef49ce41445c0a5383c0fb3ec5.webp?image_crop_resized=960x540)\n\nClick for sound\n\n2:14\n\n## How to create a customer satisfaction survey\n\nWhen creating a customer satisfaction survey, consider the information you want to obtain. Several customer satisfaction survey questions can help you understand distinct aspects of your customer journey.\n\nFor example, you could ask questions to understand pricing satisfaction and get [purchase feedback](https://www.surveymonkey.com/use-cases/purchase-experience/):\n\n- How satisfied are you with the pricing of our service?\n- How satisfied are you with the product you received in exchange for the price you paid?\n- Do you believe that our product offers good value for the money?\n\nOr, you could search out information on overall customer satisfaction:\n\n- What would you suggest to help us improve our product?\n- Please rate your overall satisfaction with our company.\n- On a scale of 1 to 10, how satisfied are you with our service?\n\nYou could even ask [customer service satisfaction](https://www.surveymonkey.com/use-cases/customer-service-feedback/) questions:\n\n- How would you rate your satisfaction with the communication you received from our customer support department?\n- Did we manage to resolve your issue to your satisfaction?\n- Please rate the helpfulness of our customer service representatives on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nThe key to creating a great customer satisfaction survey is to start with your goal in mind. The objective of your feedback survey will inform the questions you select. Start with your goal and then customize a [customer satisfaction survey template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/customer-satisfaction-survey-template/) to your liking.\n\n[Try this template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/sign-up/?ep=%2Fcreate%2Ftemplates%2F293 \"Try this template\")\n\n## 5 customer satisfaction survey question types\n\nGetting useful and actionable answers requires asking the right [types of questions](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/survey-question-types/) for your customer satisfaction surveys.\n\nLet’s explore how to use different question types to effectively measure customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1\\. Likert scale questions\n\nThe [Likert scale](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/what-to-ask-in-your-customer-service-surveys/) is a standard survey question that measures opinions with a higher degree of flexibility than a simple yes or no. This scale offers customers the option to detail their level of agreement, usually across between 5 and 7 responses from ‘Strongly Agree’ to ‘Strongly Disagree.’\n\nBusinesses can use the Likert scale to measure various sentiments, including agreement, satisfaction, desirability, and frequency. For example, you might want to know how often customers use your online help portal, in which case a frequency response (i.e., Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Frequently) would be useful.\n\nHere are three examples of a customer service Likert scale survey question:\n\n- Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with our company?\n- Rate your level of agreement with the statement: “The customer service team provided by our company met your expectations.”\n- How likely are you to recommend our company’s products based on your overall satisfaction?\n\nLearn more about the [Likert scale](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/likert-scale/) and how you can use it in your next survey.\n\n### 2\\. Open-ended questions\n\n[Open-ended questions](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/survey-best-practices/open-ended-questions-get-more-context-to-enrich-your-data/) allow customers to share their thoughts and opinions for more in-depth insights and new ideas.\n\nFor example, this [Market Research Survey Template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/market-research-survey-template/) starts with several open-ended questions that ask customers to list specific things they like and changes they would like to see:\n\n- What do you like most about our new product?\n- What changes would most improve our product?\n- What changes would most improve competing products currently available from other companies?\n\nOpen-ended questions give respondents the freedom to answer as they please. The added flexibility of this question type can elicit useful and detailed information for your company. This question style can also provide supplementary qualitative data alongside your quantitative questions.\n\n### Create a customer satisfaction survey in minutes\n\nGet started with our expert-written CSAT questions and create a custom survey for your business goals.\n\n[Build a survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/create/ \"Build a survey\")\n\n### 3\\. Nominal questions\n\nNominal questions are naming scales that pinpoint different categories of questions. These answers don’t have a numerical value. In addition, the answers are not connected unless you add an option for “all of the above.”\n\nThe answers to nominal questions have no specific order; they carry significance for variable labels only.\n\nHere are some examples of nominal questions:\n\n- What brands of shoes from our online store do you prefer?\n- Which social media platform do you use most to connect with friends?\n- What is your preferred method of transportation during your daily commute?\n\nEach question has a specific answer for the user that will give your company more context to their preferences and experiences.\n\nExplore more [customer satisfaction survey questions](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/customer-satisfaction-survey-questions/).\n\n### 4\\. Binary questions\n\nBinary scale questions rely on a limit of two answers per question, hence the name “binary.” You can present these questions as a simple yes or no or allow customers to answer with graphics like a thumbs up/thumbs down or happy/sad face.\n\nHere are some examples of Binary scale questions:\n\n- Did you find the products you were looking for on our website? Yes / No.\n- Were you satisfied with the delivery condition of your recent order? Yes / No.\n- Did you experience any technical difficulties on our website?
