Whether you’re a Fortune 500 company or a small startup, you can use [market research surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/roles/research/) to better understand your target audience.\n\nYou can use these surveys to access key demographic information, finding out just about anything—from what customers like about your business to what kind of products your market needs.\n\nTo position yourself to keep existing customers or gain new business, you’ll need the right data to back you up. Let’s discover how to create and conduct market research surveys to get the information you need.\n\n## What is a market research survey?\n\nA [market research survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/marketing/) is a research method used to gather insights, information, and data from your target audience. Sending out a tailored survey allows you to collect extensive feedback on a large scale. With ample responses, you can turn survey results into actionable steps to improve your business.\n\nHere’s a glimpse of some of the information you can gather with market research surveys:\n\n- **Demographic information:** Data on your customers’ gender identification, income level, age, highest level of education, location, and more.\n- **Purchasing habits:** You can survey people’s buying habits, questioning how often they shop with your business.\n- **Opinions:** You can use market research surveys to ask your audience what they think about your products and services.\n- **Desires:** Survey your audience to gather insight on what they would like to see your business provide in the future or what the market lacks.\n- **Intentions:** Discover whether customers would be more or less likely to shop with your brand if you provided certain services.\n\nAs a form of data collection that’s quick to deploy and easy to scale, market research surveys are by far one of the best methods to gather insight from your customers.\n\n**_Related reading:_** [_Why are surveys important in research?_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/survey-best-practices/why-are-surveys-important-in-research/)\n\n## Market research vs. marketing research\n\nWhile market research and marketing research may sound similar, they provide different information.\n\nMarket research gathers data that can help a business better serve its customers. Market research is vital when businesses want to enhance their offerings and improve their products.\n\nOn the other hand, marketing research identifies data that can support your marketing team’s efforts. Marketing research revolves around the four P’s of marketing: product, pricing, place, or promotion. Here’s what each of these segments of marketing research hopes to discover:\n\n- **Product:** What aspects or features of the product or service are most valuable for a customer?\n- **Pricing:** Is the current price too high, too low, or just right for customers?\n- **Place:** Is the product widely available through the purchase pathways that customers want to interact with?\n- **Promotion:** What forms of advertising and the delivery channel are best for the customer?\n\nSimply put, marketing research is any data that informs the customer’s purchase decision. Marketing teams can use this data to enhance packaging, optimize pricing strategies, and deliver effective advertising to the customer.\n\nMarket research is a much broader form of customer data capture that spans all [customer touchpoints](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/identify-customer-touchpoints/) and focuses on the [customer experience](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/customer-feedback/what-is-customer-experience-and-how-to-improve-it/) (CX) with your brand as good as it can be.\n\n## Primary vs. secondary market research\n\nBefore you begin your market research survey, it’s a good idea to become familiar with the two main types of market research: Primary market research and secondary market research.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Definition** | **Methods** | **Real-world example** |\n| **Primary market research** is the act of gathering data that you haven’t already collected. | • Conducting online surveys<br>• Running a focus group<br>• Hosting 1-1 customer interviews<br>• Interviewing industry experts or SMEs | A business creates a survey about purchase habits and then shares it with its customers. |\n| **Secondary market research** is the act of gathering data that someone has already produced. | • Pre-existing company data<br>• Pre-existing market data<br>• Public records<br>• Government reports<br>• Public industry reports<br>• Consumer market trend data | A business accesses an [existing study](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/dating-apps-and-sites-are-almost-as-common-as-they-are-disliked/) to gather data on an industry trend that interests them. |\n\nWant to learn more? Read our complete guide on [the difference between primary and secondary research](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/market-research/primary-vs-secondary-research/).\n\n## Types of market research survey\n\nWhen launching market research surveys, you should have a clear intent in mind. The more specific your survey is, the more precise the data you gather will be.\n\nBefore diving into specific survey types, you may want to understand the fundamental approaches to survey research. Learn about [the three main types of survey research](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/3-types-survey-research/) — exploratory, descriptive, and causal — to help you choose the right framework for your market research goals.\n\nNow, let’s explore some of the most common types of market research surveys.\n\n### Competitor research survey\n\nA competitor research survey allows a business to discover who its competitors are and how its customers perceive them.\n\nTypical questions on a competitor research survey include purchase frequency questions and open-ended “when you think of this product category, what brands come to mind?”\n\nYou can use a [competitor research survey template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/competitor-research-survey-template/) to rapidly measure your competitor ecosystem.\n\n### Consumer behavior survey\n\nA consumer behavior survey aims to understand where each customer is on their customer journey. By surveying how they feel about your brand against their purchasing stage, you can gather more information to help move them along their journey.\n\nTypical questions in a consumer behavior survey are:\n\n- Are you the primary decision maker in your household regarding purchasing this product category?\n- How do you typically find out about brands in this product category?\n- Which of the following brands are you aware of?\n\nA [consumer behavior survey template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/consumer-behavior-survey-template/) will allow you to monitor how your customer sentiment changes over time.\n\n### Brand personality survey\n\nThe public image of your brand can rapidly change, with customers developing opinions based on your public actions and advertising techniques. A brand personality survey monitors how your customers perceive your brand.\n\nHere are some typical questions on a brand personality survey:\n\n- When was the last time you used this product category?\n- What words first come to mind when you think of our brand?\n- How unique is our brand?\n\nGet started with a [brand personality survey template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/brand-personality-survey-template/) to understand your brand associations and how they change over time.\n\n### Typical customer demographics survey\n\nA typical customer demographics survey will gather information on all relevant demographic features of your clients' customers. By getting to know who makes up your clients’ audiences, you can better help them succeed.\n\nCommon questions on a customer demographics survey are:\n\n- How old is your target customer?\n- What gender does your target customer typically identify as?\n- What is the highest level of school your target customer has completed?\n\nGet started with a [typical customer demographics survey template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/typical-customer-demographics-survey-template/) to better help your clients succeed.\n\n### Price testing survey\n\nPrice is one of the central factors that influence buying decisions. A price testing survey will help evaluate whether or not your customers are happy with the amount they pay for your products and services.\n\nHere are three routine questions on a price testing survey:\n\n- How often do you purchase this product category?\n- How much do you typically pay for this product category?\n- How satisfied are you with the amount of money you typically pay for this product category?\n\nUse the [SurveyMonkey price testing template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/price-testing-survey-template/) to rapidly poll your audience and get the insights you need to optimize your pricing strategy.\n\n## 13 ways market research surveys can grow your business\n\nTake action on your market research survey knowledge. Here are a few of the most popular ways businesses use market research surveys and how to get the best data out of them.\n\n### 1\\. Reach a specific audience\n\nSurveys are a great opportunity to get input from your target market. With market research survey results from your target market, you can make customer-centered, data-driven campaigns and solutions that exceed customer needs and drive business profitability.\n\nIf you have trouble finding your target market, you can reach them through our panel of respondents on [SurveyMonkey Audience](https://www.surveymonkey.com/product/market-research/audience-panel/).\n\n### 2\\. Research and analyze a target market\n\nA market research survey can help you understand several aspects of your target market, allowing you to improve the quality of your decisions. This includes anything from understanding the potential market size to determining the optimal price for your products.\n\nBefore you earmark funds for any marketing plans or initiatives, you need to be confident that the strategies you’re considering will drive your success.\n\n### 3\\. Measure brand awareness\n\nYour company or product might mean the world to you, but it’s hard to know what your target market thinks of it. A [brand awareness survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/brand-awareness-survey-template/) can help you understand what your customers and prospects think about your company, image, and products.\n\nAsk respondents how they feel about you compared to your competitors and why they are interested in your products and services.\n\n### 4\\. Gain insights on your product, or a future product\n\nSending an online product feedback survey to your target audience will help you gain insights that drive product improvements, innovations, and ultimately lead to efforts that boost sales.\n\nTo get product feedback, you’ll ask questions like: “What changes would most improve our new product?” Or, “What do you like most about competing products currently available from other companies?”\n\n**_Related reading:_** [_**New Product Research Template**_](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/market-research-product-survey-template/)\n\n### 5\\. Analyze competitors\n\nWant to know who you should keep an eye on in the market? The best way to get an answer is by asking your target audience. You’ll get an inside look at their buying process and how they think about products that are similar to yours.\n\n**_Related reading:_** _[What is data analysis, and why is it important in market research?](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/data-analysis-in-market-research/)_\n\n### 6\\. Research and analyze a target market\n\nWith the increasing importance of social media in your marketing mix, [online social media surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/marketing/social-media-surveys/) are a great way to figure out which social media channels you need to pay attention to.\n\nSurveys help you understand the “why” and give you ideas for how to serve your market better on each channel.\n\n### 7\\. Dive deeper into customer demographics\n\nNeed to identify potential [customer demographics](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/demographic-survey/) in a new service area? Ask potential customers about their gender, age, location, income, where they shop, what they do for fun, how many children they have, and more.\n\nDemographic information is essential to helping you [understand your target market](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/why-filtering-your-data-by-demographic-groups-is-a-game-changer/), which, in turn, improves your messaging and campaigns.\n\n### 8\\. Conduct market segmentation\n\n[Segmenting your target market](https://www.surveymonkey.com/market-research/resources/market-segmentation/) by honing in on smaller groups that share common attributes (such as demographics, geography, lifestyle, product usage, brand affinity, etc) might help support decision-making processes and tip the scale in your favor.\n\nWhen you do market research, it’s easier to identify different segments and know what they want.\n\n### 9\\. Decide which creative assets to use in your next campaign\n\nWould your target audience be more likely to respond to an online banner ad or a billboard on the highway close to their homes? [Market research surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/product/market-research/) can help you put these questions to the test and get feedback that points you in the right direction.\n\nOver the long run, you’ll be in a position to better prioritize your ad spend and resources.\n\n### 10\\. Test branding, positioning, and naming\n\nThe most revered brands listen to their target audience, and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. [Test branding and naming concepts](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/name-testing-survey-template/) to help you understand the attitudes, motivations, and preferences of consumers, especially in relation to your competitors.\n\n### 11\\. Understand consumer sentiment in the wider market\n\nWhen it comes to investing, there will always be uncertainty. To help you feel better in deciding where to buy and what to sell, research consumers’ opinions on markets and industries. Running [investment research surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/market-research/investment-research/) on a consistent basis will help you decide when to make changes to your portfolio.\n\n### 12\\. Create fresh, original content\n\nBuilding stories that reference people’s opinions and preferences benefits your content in all sorts of ways. It helps you uncover [new, fresh angles](https://www.surveymonkey.com/product/market-research/audience-panel/) you wouldn’t have discovered on your own. At the same time, it adds a ton of credibility to your claims and attracts coverage in the press.\n\n### 13\\. Perform academic research\n\nProgress in academia often requires tangible, real-world data. Consumer feedback offers the data points you need to move your research forward, whether you’re a researcher or a graduate student.\n\n## Market research survey best practices\n\nAn expert-made [market research survey template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/market-research-survey-templates/) (vetted by our survey research scientists) can help you begin your own market research. You’ll be able to ask your target audience about their demographics, preferences, and more.\n\nNo matter what you decide to conduct your market research on, these tips will help you make sure your market research survey is on the right track.\n\n### 1\\. Define the problem\n\nMarket research is often a long-term and ongoing process. Structure your research efforts with an objective that your team can rally around.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n- What problem are you trying to solve with this data?\n- How will it benefit your product, your customers, or your company in general?\n- What form of data response would be ideal for your research?\n\nAsking these questions will focus your research and help you understand the issues and the type of data you need.\n\n### 2\\. Establish research objectives\n\nOnce you’ve identified your problem, you’ll need to set a research objective that focuses on how you’ll complete your study. Essentially, your objective is a goal you’re hoping to reach with your market research survey.\n\nTo come up with direct, thoughtful goals, you’ll need to ask yourself a variety of who, what, and how questions that help you [set a goal for your survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/survey-best-practices/setting-survey-goal/).\n\n### 3\\. Target the right audience\n\nDetermine why you’re trying to reach your audience. It’s also worth considering how niche your audience is.\n\nThe more specific your audience criteria get, the harder it becomes to identify enough respondents. It also gets more expensive.\n\nTo ensure you have a suitable sample size that fits within your budget, consider loosening your population criteria. Alternatively, you can use [screening questions](https://www.surveymonkey.com/resources/guide-to-using-screening-questions/) at the beginning of your survey to either qualify or disqualify respondents from taking it.\n\n### 4\\. Decide on your margin of error\n\nYour margin of error is the degree of confidence that your results match up with the opinions and preferences of the entire population (of those who fit your criteria). Understanding your [margin of error](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/margin-of-error-calculator/) will help you prove that your results are [statistically valid](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/how-many-people-do-i-need-to-take-my-survey/).\n\n### 5\\. Set timelines\n\nWhen will you send your survey out? How many times will you send it out? When are you hoping to get all your information?\n\nThese questions help you set timelines for your survey. They also impact the quality and quantity of responses you receive. For example, surveys have a higher response rate between the hours of [9-10 am than 10-11pm](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/responds-online-surveys-hour-day/).\n\n### 6\\. Use resources and tools to help you\n\nWhen creating an effective market research survey, you don’t have to start from scratch.\n\nSurveyMonkey offers an immense number of market research survey examples. Use them as templates for creating your own survey or as a guide that can help you build one that meets all your needs.\n\n### 7\\. Use the right tools to start collecting and analyzing data\n\nYou have a variety of options at your disposal when selecting [how to send out your survey](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/sending-your-survey/).\n\nOnce your data starts to come back, you can use the [SurveyMonkey Analyze tools](https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/analyzing-results/) to conduct your data analysis at a high level. Additionally, you can thank your customers once you receive their data. Assure them that what they say in your survey will matter and that [their voice](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/voice-of-the-customer/) can lead to an improved customer experience.\n\n_**Related reading**: [Target market analysis: Why it matters and how to perform it](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/market-research/target-market-analysis-why-it-matters-and-how-to-perform-it/)_\n\n## Create market research surveys with SurveyMonkey\n\nMarket research surveys are powerful for gathering customer data to improve your products and services.\n\nWith SurveyMonkey, you can rapidly create, send out, and analyze survey response data.
