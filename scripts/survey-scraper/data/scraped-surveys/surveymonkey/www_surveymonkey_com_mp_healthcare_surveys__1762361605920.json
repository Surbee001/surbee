trust, satisfaction, and positive health outcomes.\n\nQuality of care is the extent to which health services for individuals and populations enhance the likelihood of achieving desired health outcomes, according to The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/quality-of-care#tab=tab_1) (WHO).\n\nWhen patients receive attentive, effective, and compassionate care, they’re more likely to feel supported and engaged throughout their healthcare journey.\n\nHealthcare surveys are a valuable tool used by healthcare providers, clinics, and hospitals to measure and improve patient care. This article explains what healthcare surveys are, their different types, how to use them, and more.\n\n## What is a healthcare survey?\n\n**Healthcare surveys are tools used to collect feedback from patients, caregivers, or staff regarding their experiences, satisfaction, and the quality of care provided.** Healthcare professionals use these surveys to continuously enhance patient satisfaction and care quality.\n\n### Empower your team with expert-written healthcare survey templates\n\nUnlock insights to improve both patient and employee experiences.\n\n[Grab your template](https://www.surveymonkey.com/categories/templates/healthcare-surveys/ \"Grab your template\")\n\n**Related reading:** [**How to conduct healthcare surveys**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/healthcare/how-to-conduct-healthcare-surveys/)\n\n## Why healthcare surveys are important\n\nHealthcare surveys offer clinicians and staff important insights into patient perspectives on the care they receive.

By monitoring [healthcare employee engagement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/healthcare/healthcare-employee-engagement-survey/) and aiming to improve it, you’ll enhance customer experiences.\n- **Centralize hospital survey data in one place:** Surveys offer a helpful way to centralize various forms of data collection, enabling better management of all your data in one location.\n- **Streamline patient intake:** Your business can leverage [online registration forms](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/healthcare/healthcare-nps/) and [medical history forms](https://www.surveymonkey.com/templates/medical-history-form-template/) to rapidly check in new patients and ensure all your documents are in one convenient location.\n- **Benchmark patient satisfaction and loyalty:** Constantly measuring customer experience metrics, such as the [Net Promoter Score](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/healthcare/healthcare-nps/), will help your business benchmark progress over time. You can refer to this data to prove the efficacy of your customer and [employee experience programs](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/employee-experience-management/).\n- **Perform market research:** [Market research surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/market-research-surveys/) gather various metrics, like customer sentiment, to help you determine how your business measures against industry competitors.\n\n**Related reading:** [**NPS benchmarks & best practices in healthcare**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/healthcare/healthcare-nps/)\n\n## Best practices for conducting healthcare surveys\n\nA great healthcare survey goes beyond just sending out a request for information from your patients. A great survey will include the right questions and come at the right time, maximizing the quality of the information you receive from each patient.\n\nHere are some of our top tips for conducting [effective healthcare surveys](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/healthcare/how-to-conduct-healthcare-surveys/).\n\n### 1\\. Keep surveys short and focused\n\nThe longer the survey, the higher the exit rate. If a patient feels overwhelmed by the number of questions or the time required to complete a survey, they may simply leave without finishing.\n\nOf the many things you should consider in your [survey design](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/survey-design/), consider the minimum number of questions needed to achieve your goal. How can you get from A to B in as few questions as possible?\n\n### 2\\. Use clear and respectful language\n\nHealthcare surveys gather information that some patients may feel is sensitive or, in some cases, embarrassing. You must balance empathy and professionalism to increase survey response rates and data accuracy.\n\nUse neutral language where appropriate. For example, a leading question like, “Tell us how well the staff members treated you with respect and courtesy,” may make patients feel pressured to respond positively. Additionally, use inclusive language and consider giving respondents the option not to disclose information.\n\n### 3\\. Ask both closed and open-ended questions\n\nYou’ll want to balance [closed and open-ended questions](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/comparing-closed-ended-and-open-ended-questions/) to give your patients the flexibility to answer how they’d like. You’ll also gather rich quantitative and qualitative data.\n\nMore dedicated responders may fill out your open-ended questions to give as much detail as possible. Speed finishers will whiz through and give you the minimum level of detail you’re looking for.\n\n[Quantitative data](https://www.surveymonkey.com/market-research/resources/quantitative-research-and-surveys/) can be used to track changes over time, while [qualitative data](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/conducting-qualitative-research/) is particularly well-suited for making targeted improvements.\n\n### 4\\. Ensure anonymity and privacy\n\nAnother good rule-of-thumb is ensuring your patients know their responses are anonymous. Doctors and nurses hold a position of authority over patients’ healthcare, and healthcare settings can make some feel uneasy, making patients feel hesitant to share candid feedback.\n\nPeople will feel more comfortable giving honest, candid feedback when anonymous, helping you to make real improvements in your organization.\n\n### 5\\. Choose the right timing (pre-visit, post-discharge, etc.)\n\nSurveys can be sent at different times. Ensure the timing of your survey aligns with its goals.\n\nYou can use surveys to gather information throughout the service timeline—pre-visit to measure scheduling efficiency, post-discharge to measure visit satisfaction with hospital care, and more.\n\n### 6\\. Use digital tools for easy distribution and tracking\n\nDistributing your survey effectively is almost as important as the survey questions. For example, if your audience hardly ever uses social media, distributing a link via Facebook would be ineffective. Understanding the channels that your patients use will help you increase response rates.\n\nMany healthcare organizations already communicate with their patients via email. If you’re unsure how to distribute your survey, we suggest you send it to the email address that a patient currently receives communications from your business.\n\n### 7\\. Act on results and share improvements\n\nAfter you've taken painstaking measures to perfect your survey design and ensure compliance with regulatory boards, act on your survey results.\n\nFirst, conduct statistical analyses to find significant data points. Then, share the results with stakeholders—health professionals, administrators, and executives. Inform patients of actions you plan on taking in response to the feedback to build trust and loyalty.\n\n### 8\\. Consider HIPAA compliance and data protection\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted in the late 1990s. According to HIPAA, protected health information (PHI) must be protected according to federally required security and privacy standards. Any organization that does not comply could potentially face serious penalties. Using a HIPAA-compliant survey will help prevent inappropriate use or disclosure of PHI.\n\n**Related reading:** [**HIPAA Compliance at SurveyMonkey**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/product/features/hipaa-compliance/)\n\n### 9\\. Provide context and purpose\n\nContext matters when requesting information from patients. To ensure your business receives high-quality data, you need to contextualize the survey to your patients. When you send out a survey, introduce who it is from, why you’re sending it, and how you’ll use their feedback.\n\nPeople are much more likely to take a survey if they understand your goal and know that their answers might positively impact their future experiences.\n\n**Related reading: Learn** [**how to create a wellbeing survey**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/learn/employee-feedback/wellbeing-survey/)\n\n## Conduct effective healthcare surveys with SurveyMonkey\n\nHealthcare providers are tasked with the delicate job of providing premier patient care in a high-pressure environment.
